I am passionate about researching climate change adaptation and mitigation in the ocean. 
For my PhD thesis, I am working to monitor hypoxia (low oxygen conditions) off the Oregon Coast and in Puget Sound with the help of local fishers, agencies, and tribes. With this work, I am answering question about hpow hypoxia effect Dungness Crab, the spatial extent of hypoxia, and how low oxygen effects carbon sequestration in the ocean.
